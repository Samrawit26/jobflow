# Directives

Human-readable SOPs and runbooks (Layer 1).

Directives describe **what to do** in plain language:
- Goals and objectives
- Inputs and outputs
- Step-by-step procedures
- Edge cases and error handling
- Safety constraints

**These are living documents** that must be updated as the system learns.

Claude reads these before acting on any task.
